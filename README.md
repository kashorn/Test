Test
====

This is just a simple repo to test out the functionality my new GitHub UI client on Windows and to work through an Android App development tutorial.

Note: there is a typo in the name of the app ("Andriod" vs. "Android") but it has been left as created since this is simply a tutorial project and changing the name in all of the many relevant places in an environment I'm not familiar with is more trouble than constructive
